If I knew the program would be handling a 10GB CSV input file, I would split the input file into smaller chunks (about 1000 rows each) and process each in a separate thread using Task.Run(). To make sure all threads have been completed before proceeding, I would use Task.WhenAll(tasks). This approach speeds up the processing of large files due to distributing the workload across multiple threads. 
Also, it would be better to create indexes of the table after the import of all the data is finished.
