1. Creating the database
	CREATE DATABASE ETLDatabase;
2. Creating the table

	CREATE TABLE Trips(
		Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
		PULocationID INT,
		DOLocationID INT,
		fare_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
		tip_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
		passenger_count INT,
		trip_distance DECIMAL(10,3),
		tpep_pickup_datetime DATETIME,
		tpep_dropoff_datetime DATETIME,
		store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(3),
	);
	
3. Optimisation for queries like these
	 
	Highest average tip by pick-up location:
  		SELECT PULocationID,AVG(tip_amount) as average_tips
  		FROM Trips
  		GROUP BY PULocationID
  		ORDER BY average_tips DESC;
	Created an index to speed up aggregations
		CREATE INDEX idx_tip ON Trips (PULocationId, tip_amount);

	100 longest fares by trip distance:
		SELECT TOP 100 trip_distance FROM Trips
		ORDER BY trip_distance DESC;
	Added  an index to optimise sorting for fetching top 100 longest trips
		CREATE INDEX idx_distance ON Trips (trip_distance);

	100 longest fares by time spent travelling:
		SELECT TOP 100 tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime, 
		DATEDIFF(MINUTE, tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime) AS duration FROM Trips
		ORDER BY duration DESC;
	Indexed tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime columns for faster calculations
		CREATE INDEX idx_time ON Trips (tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime);

	Search by pick-up location:
		SELECT * FROM Trips
		WHERE PULocationId = 132;
	Added an index on PULocationId column for faster search performance, when filtering by PULocationId:
		CREATE INDEX idx_pu_loc ON Trips (PULocationId);
